FEATURES OF JAVA:

1.SIMPLE:

--> Java syntax is very easy to learn and it is based on syntax of c++.
--> Java has an Automatic Garbage collector which will remove unreferenced/unnamed objects automatically and frees programmers from memory management responsibilities.

2.OBJECT ORIENTED:

--> Java is an object oriented programming language and it provides great flexibility,modularity,clarity,reusability and OOPs is more secure as it provides data hiding features.

3.PLATFORM INDEPENDENT:

--> Java has a "write once and run anywhere" feature.
--> Additional layer in java is added to achieve platform independence.This additional layer is known as byte code or class file and we have different JVM for different OS.
--> So by using byte code and different JVM for different OS java achieves its platform independence.

4.ARCHITECHTURE NEUTRAL:

--> There are no architechural dependent features in java such as the size of primitive data types is fixed.

5.PORTABLE:

--> Platform independent and architechtural neutral features of java make it portable and also we can carry the java bytecode to any platform.

6.ROBUST:

--> Robust means reliable.In Java we have exception handling mechanism which catches and responds to it so that a program can continue its normal execution.
--> Java doesnt support pointers thereby eliminating the possibilities of overwriting memory and corrupt data.

7.SECURE:

--> Java is known for its security and java proframs runs under area known as sand box.
--> Java uses a public key encryption system to allow the java application transmit over the internet in the secured encrpted form.

8.HIGH PERFORMANCE:

--> Java is not as fast as compiled languages such as c/c++ but its faster than other interpreted languagues.
--> JVm uses new technology known as just in time compilation(JIT) it converts byte code to machine code on demand basis.

9.MULTI-THREADED:

--> Multithreading means breaking one program into multiple programs to perform independently at the same time.It is particularly usefful in server applications.
-->In java threads can be used in two ways by extending thread class and by implementing runnable interface.

10.DISTRIBUTED:

--> In distributed computing several computers work together on a network.
