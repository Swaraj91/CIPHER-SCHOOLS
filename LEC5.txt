OPERATORS AND OPERANDS:

int r= a + j
here a,j are operands
and '+' is the operator

INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS:

x++ --> operation is performed first then the value is incremented

++x --> value is incremented first then the operation is performed

x-- --> operation is performed first then the value is decremented

--x --> value is decremented first then the operation is performed

int i=5;
int j=i++;
System.out.println("I is :" + i +",J is :" + j);

int q=5;
int p=++q;
System.out.println("I is :" + q+",J is :" + p);
